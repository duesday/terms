## Terms and Conditions

Version 1.2 (31 October 2019)
### What is Duesday ü§î

Duesday is the brand name of CFT Group, a limited company registered in sunny Cornwall.

The legal terms in this document (English law applies) are between you and CFT Group Ltd (Duesday/us/we) and you agree to them by using the Duesday app.

You should read this document along with our Privacy Policy.
### How to contact us üí¨

You can contact us through the Duesday app, by email at help@duesday.com, by phone on 03331122999 or by letter to: Duesday, 2 Pike Street, Liskeard, PL14 3JE.

We will contact you via the Duesday app, or through your email, phone or home address. Please let us know if any of these change! You can update your details directly in the app.
### Setting up your details üîí

To use our service you have to verify your name, mobile number, email address and residential address. We are required to collect these details to prevent Duesday being used for fraud or money laundering. We store all of your details in a secretly encrypted format inside a secure digital vault.

From time to time or when your details change we may ask you to re-verify the personal information we hold for you. If you don't verify those details we may not be able to pay bills on your behalf and you must find other ways to pay the company or service provider which billed you. 

To pay your bills through Duesday you need to provide us with your bank account and/or card details and agree to our terms. We store your bank account details in secretly encrypted format in a secure digital vault. Your payment card details are not stored by us at all, but instead we receive a secure payment token for your bill payments which can only be used by Duesday.
### How we pay your bills üí∑

We use Direct Debit to pay bills from your bank account and continuous payment authority to pay bills with your Visa or Mastercard. Our Duesday app lets you see which bills need to be paid and when they're due. For some bills, but not all, you can change when and how the payment is taken. The amount you pay will be transferred to our Duesday account and from there to the company or service provider which billed you. 
### How we split your bills ü§ù

Some bills, but not all allow you to split them between you and your friends. When you configure a bill to share through the Duesday app, we invite your sharers to join Duesday through the contact details you have given us. Your sharers need to set up a Duesday account and accept your bill-splitting request before we can split the bills for you. If a bill sharer cannot pay us we may contact you to cover the amount owed by your sharers instead.
### How Duesday Duros work üìä

For some bills, but not all, you can decide to pay before the due date and get rewarded with Duesday Duros. The earlier you pay and the higher the amount, the more Duros you receive in return. 

You receive one Duro for every ¬£1 and every day you pay your duro-enabled bill before the due date of the bill. For example: if you pay your bill of ¬£50 ten days early, you receive 500 Duros.

Duesday Duros have no cash value and are not deemed to be E-money or any other equivalent monetary value. Your Duesday Duros cannot be used to withdraw cash or otherwise be redeemed for cash and they are awarded to you at the discretion of CFT Group. 

You can use the Duesday Duros you have received to delay the due date of upcoming bills. For every ¬£1 of your bill you can use a Duro to delay the due date by one day. For example, spending 500 Duros allows you to delay the due date of a ¬£100 bill by five days.

When you choose to spend your Duesday Duros to delay payments, we will allocate your Duros to the provider of the bill, who can then get a discount on the fees we charge them for processing their payments.

Duesday Duros expire 12 months from the date they are added to your virtual Duesday Duros account in your Duesday App. If your Account is closed either by you or by us, you will not be able to redeem the value of your Duesday Duros.
### If something goes wrong üò±

Please keep your phone and Duesday passcode safe at all times.

We might be able to refund any money you lost due to our mistakes or inaccuracies with your payments or due to fraudulent activity on your account.

However, you won't be able to claim losses if:

- you have carelessly failed to keep your phone and passcode safe
- you broke the terms of this agreement
- you gave us incorrect instructions (but we'll do our best to help you recover your money)
- we took actions under conditions outside of our control
- they are not the direct and predictable result of our actions
### How to make a complaint üòî

If you have a complaint, please contact us and we will do our best to fix the problem  by emailing: support@duesday.com

If you're still not happy, you can refer your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service. For more details you can visit their website at www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk.
### Making changes to this agreement üìù

This agreement will always be available in the app and on our website.

If we make changes to it that are clearly in your favour, we'll tell you once they've been made. Otherwise we will give you two months' notice.

If you don't agree to these changes, you can let us know and we will close your account. 
### Closing your account üò≠

To close your account, please get in touch with us. Any money you owe us will have to be repaid before the account can be closed. Once the account is closed, all your preferences will be deleted and no future bills will be paid through Duesday.

This step cannot be undone. Your Duesday account will be closed and all your taps and preferences will be deleted.

We can close your account by giving you at least two months' notice. We may close your account or suspend use of your app immediately if we believe you have:

- broken the terms of this agreement
- put us in a position where we might break the law
- broken the law or attempted to break the law
- given us false information at any time
- behaved in an abusive manner to anyone at Duesday or a member of the Duesday community

### What happens if I can't pay my Direct Debits?

We know that there are times when people fall behind with payments, for a variety of reasons. Duesday is a payment service, to pay your regular bills, but we don't give credit. If you are falling behind with your Direct Debits, we can't pay your bills for you.

If you are struggling to pay your Direct Debits, we want you to speak to us. We will always be able to help, and we don't want to add to your worry.

And we know that people can be in debt with lots of other organisations or individuals. We recognise that this can be a difficult time and we can support you.

If you are falling behind with your Direct Debits, we can't pay your bills for you. When this happens here is how you will be contacted:
#### Text message contact üì©

First we will send you a text message or an in-app notification to let you know that we need to take a catch up payment so we can settle the unpaid bill for you.
#### Email contact üì©

If you haven't taken action to address your outstanding payment, we will follow up with an email. We'll then send another text message and email asking you to contact us as soon as possible.

Let us know if you're having problems making payment - get in touch straight away.

If after a period of time our first communication with you about your outstanding payment we haven't heard back, you'll get a text and email asking to arrange a date and time for us to call you and discuss the best options.
#### Reminder to get in touch üìÜ

A final reminder will be sent by email and text message if after several weeks we have not heard back from you. Throughout this time, we are unable to pay any bills for you.

If you are falling behind with payments and want to talk about managing your account please email us on help@duesday.com
